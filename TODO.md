# TODO Plan for Game Asset Management Postgres Database

## Phase 1: Planning and Design
- Research games industry asset management needs: Focus on metadata for files like 3D models, textures, audio; include versioning, user access, and audit logs.
- Design schema: Entities for Assets, Versions, Users, Permissions, Tags. Use UUIDs for IDs, JSONB for flexible metadata.
- Plan security: Role-based access, row-level security (RLS).
- Decide on tools: PostgreSQL 16, Docker for easy setup/testing.

## Phase 2: Implementation
- Create Docker Compose file for spinning up Postgres instance.
- Write SQL scripts:
  - Schema creation (tables, relationships).
  - Indexes for performance on common queries (e.g., by tag, user).
  - Triggers for auditing and versioning.
  - Sample data insertion for demo.
- Develop backup/restore scripts in Bash for operational reliability.
- Provide sample config files for Postgres tuning.

## Phase 3: Documentation and Testing
- Write README.md: Cover setup, usage, schema explanation, and integration tips for game dev pipelines.
- Create performance-tuning.md: Guide on vacuuming, indexing strategies, connection pooling, and monitoring.
- Test locally: Use Docker to init DB, insert data, query, and simulate load.
- Add LICENSE and ensure all code is commented.

## Phase 4: Enhancements (Future)
- Integrate with CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions for schema migrations).
- Add API layer (e.g., via PostgREST) for asset querying.
- Performance benchmarks with pgbench or custom scripts.

Timeline: Aim for completion in 1-2 weeks part-time. Review for best practices in DB admin.
