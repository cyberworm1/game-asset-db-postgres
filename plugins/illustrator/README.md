# Game Asset Database Illustrator Plugin (UXP)

This UXP extension connects Adobe Illustrator to the Game Asset Database,
allowing artists to browse vector assets, palettes, and templates before
importing them into active documents. The panel also supports publishing
artwork back to the database with metadata tags.

## Development

1. Install Adobe's Unified Developer Tools (UDT).
2. Run `uxp devtools plugin start` pointing to this directory to load the
   plugin in Illustrator.
3. Update the configuration file generated by the shared `plugins/common`
   module with your API credentials before logging in.

## Distribution

Use Adobe's signing tools to create a packaged `.ccx` for distribution on
Windows and macOS. Include the `manifest.json`, `src` directory, and any
static assets.
