# Recommendations to Complete a Full Asset Management Solution

## 1. Product Vision & Guiding Principles
- Define target studio size, concurrent user load, and expected asset volume to shape scaling goals (e.g., 30 artists, 500k asset records, 10 TB storage).
- Establish asset lifecycle policy (ingest → review → publish → archive) and codify naming/versioning conventions.
- Adopt an API-first mindset: every operation accessible via REST/GraphQL and CLI to empower automation and integrations.

## 2. Core Database Enhancements
1. **Schema maturity**
   - Add projects, sequences/shots, departments, and pipelines tables to organize assets by production context.
   - Introduce task assignments, review status (WIP, pending review, approved), due dates, and notes tables to enable workflow tracking.
   - Extend `users` with authentication identifiers (SSO id, email), team membership, and status fields.
   - Move file path handling from JSONB into a dedicated `storage_locations` table with provider info (S3, NAS, GCP), checksum, file size, MIME type, and signed URL support.
   - Add dependency/relationship tables (asset uses asset, asset belongs to bundle) for build orchestration.
2. **Data integrity & safety**
   - Implement soft deletes / archival flags with retention policies.
   - Add constraints for metadata validation (JSON schema or check constraints) and standard enumerations for asset types and status fields.
   - Expand audit logging to cover all write tables, include session/user id, request origin, and correlate to application actions.
3. **Performance & maintenance**
   - Partition large tables by project or creation date.
   - Implement background jobs for analytics rollups (asset usage metrics) and support incremental vacuum/maintenance strategy docs.
   - Build migration workflow (sqitch or Flyway) to manage schema changes.

## 3. Service Layer & APIs
- Build a stateless service (NestJS, FastAPI, or Go) that exposes CRUD, search, workflow, and permission endpoints atop Postgres.
- Add authentication/authorization: integrate with OAuth2/SAML for SSO, issue short-lived tokens for plugins/automation.
- Implement role-based and attribute-based access control consistent with DB RLS policies.
- Provide bulk import/export endpoints, webhook callbacks, and event streaming (Kafka/NATS) for pipeline triggers.
- Document OpenAPI/GraphQL schema and publish SDKs (TypeScript, Python, C#).

## 4. Asset Storage & Delivery
- Decide on primary binary storage: object storage (S3 compatible) with lifecycle rules.
- Build upload service with chunked uploads, checksum verification, virus scanning, and auto-thumbnail/preview generation.
- Store previews/renditions for fast browsing (images, GLTF, video proxies) and track in DB.
- Implement CDN integration for global asset delivery with signed URL access.
- Provide storage adapters abstraction layer for on-prem NAS, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage.

## 5. Search, Discovery & Reporting
- Introduce ElasticSearch/OpenSearch for full-text, tag, metadata, and similarity search; keep Postgres as source of truth.
- Implement saved searches, smart collections, and dashboards (per project, per artist throughput).
- Build analytics on asset usage, download counts, version churn, and aging assets via materialized views or BI connectors.

## 6. Workflow & Collaboration Features
- Integrate review/approval pipeline: annotate previews, comment threads linked to versions, notification system (email, Slack, Teams).
- Implement asset locking/reservation to prevent concurrent edits; include check-in/check-out semantics for DCC plugins.
- Support task assignment with status transitions, due dates, and capacity planning views.
- Build dependency-aware publishing: ensure upstream assets approved before downstream builds.
- Add change requests and release notes generation for each milestone.

## 7. User Experience Layer
- Develop responsive web portal (React/Vue) with dashboards, asset browser, previewers (image, 3D viewport, audio player), workflow board.
- Provide CLI for batch operations (ingest, metadata edits, exports) with scripting support (Python CLI hooking into API).
- Implement notification center, user settings, and integration configuration UI.
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and internationalization for multi-language support.

## 8. DevOps, Security & Compliance
- Create infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Ansible) for repeatable deploys (dev/stage/prod) incl. managed Postgres, cache, search cluster, object storage.
- Implement CI/CD (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI) covering migrations, unit tests, integration tests (spin up services via docker-compose), security scans (Snyk, Trivy), and automated previews.
- Add observability: structured logging, metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OpenTelemetry), alerting (PagerDuty).
- Set up backup/restore automation, PITR strategy, DR runbooks, and regular restore drills.
- Ensure compliance features: access logs export, retention policies, GDPR/right-to-be-forgotten workflows.

## 9. Plugin & Integration Strategy
- Publish unified plugin SDK (language-agnostic spec + REST/GraphQL client wrappers) handling auth, caching, offline mode.
- Provide event hooks for pipeline automation (post-publish triggers to CI builds, asset dependency updates).
- Build connectors for build systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to fetch validated assets during builds.
- Integrate with communication tools (Slack, Teams) for notifications, approvals, and slash commands.

## 10. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Implement automated DB tests (pgTAP) covering constraints, RLS policies, trigger behavior.
- Build service-layer unit/integration tests and end-to-end flows (Cypress/Playwright) exercising web UI + API + DB.
- Create load testing scenarios (k6, Locust) simulating artist workflows (bulk uploads, search, version compare).
- Establish staging environment with anonymized production-like data for user acceptance testing.

## 11. Documentation & Onboarding
- Expand docs to cover: architecture diagrams, API reference, plugin guides, onboarding playbooks for IT and artists.
- Provide training materials (videos, sample pipelines) and change management plans.
- Maintain living roadmap (e.g., GitHub Projects) with milestones, priorities, KPIs.

## 12. Plugin Development Roadmap for Key DCC & Game Engines
For each integration, deliver authentication flow, UI panels, asset browser, publish/check-in workflow, dependency resolution, and background sync service. Ensure consistent UX, offline caching, and error reporting.

1. **Unity**
   - Build Unity Editor package (UPM) targeting LTS versions.
   - Features: login via OAuth device code, asset browser window with search/filter, drag-and-drop import, automatic dependency resolution (materials, textures), check-out/in with change notes, and build validation hooking into Addressables/Asset Bundles.
   - Provide scriptable pipeline API for custom import processors and post-download automation.
2. **Unreal Engine**
   - Develop Unreal Editor plugin (C++ + Blueprints) supporting 4.x/5.x.
   - Features: Content Browser integration, data layer to sync asset metadata, automated source control check-out, asset diff/compare, and event hooks for Cook/Bake pipelines.
   - Include commandlet for headless ingest/export for CI builds.
3. **Autodesk Maya**
   - Deliver Python-based plugin using Qt UI.
   - Features: scene asset manager panel, reference replacement, publish workflows (geometry validation, naming convention checks), render output submission, and offline cache for large assets.
   - Integrate with render farm submission tools (Deadline, Tractor) using asset metadata.
4. **Blender**
   - Provide Blender add-on (Python) with sidebar asset browser, link/append support, version switching, and custom operators for publishing renders/previews.
   - Support background sync for textures and geometry caches, plus on-save validation (naming, scale units).
5. **Adobe Substance 3D Painter/Designer**
   - Build plugin to push/pull materials and textures, maintain param presets, and auto-publish outputs to asset versions.
   - Offer shelf integration, tag syncing, and metadata update hooks.
6. **Other Integrations**
   - Houdini (digital asset management & PDG integration), Nuke (compositing scripts), Photoshop (texture revisions), and Jira/ShotGrid connectors for task linkage.

## 13. Rollout Strategy
- Prioritize MVP: API service, web UI, storage integration, Unity/Maya plugins.
- Define phased releases with feedback loops from pilot teams; measure adoption, performance, and workflow efficiency.
- Plan customer support processes (ticketing, knowledge base, SLA commitments).
